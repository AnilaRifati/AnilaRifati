o(^▽^)o Hello, My name is Anila I am a 20 year old Software Engineering graduate from Kosovo.

As a recent college graduate, I am excited to showcase the diverse range of projects I had the opportunity to work on during my 3-year academic journey. These projects not only allowed me to apply the theoretical knowledge I gained in the classroom but also empowered me to enhance my skills as a developer.

One of the standout projects was my Thesis Project, where I independently designed and developed an interactive web application for a Professional Training Academy. The purpose of this web application was to equip students with the skills necessary for their future career prospects. This project allowed me to showcase my expertise in both front-end and back-end development, as I was responsible for crafting the user interface and implementing the underlying functionality.

Additionally, I had the chance to develop a C# Application, a Management System for a Ballet Academy, utilizing the .NET Framework. This project involved creating modules for student registration, managing information about ballet courses and their respective instructors, as well as handling student payment records. By implementing this system, I was able to enhance the administrative efficiency of the academy.

Furthermore, I delved into the realm of video game development, creating a project titled "SaikiK's Gelatines" using JavaFX. This game revolves around the main character, Saiki, from the popular Japanese manga and anime series "The Disastrous Life of Saiki K." The player's objective is to control Saiki and consume as much coffee gelatin scattered throughout the environment, featuring attractive 2D pixel art visuals and accompanying audio effects. This project allowed me to explore my creativity and showcase my skills in game development.

My main goal is to continue learning more about enhancing my skills and being much more creative, as well as learning how to make my ideas functional. o(*￣▽￣*)o
